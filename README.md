Joe Bingo (Joedle) is a mini-project by a group of students in Camosun's ICS class X02. 

The game is about our Web Design instructor, Joe, and how he has about 100+ hobbies outside of work.
This is a simple game of Bingo where you select a box of the bingo card whenever he mentions or hints about that particular hobby.
The hobbies in the bingo card are randomly curated from a set list of hobbies which ranges from hobbies he had already previously mentioned or has a high probablilty that he could have done them at some point.

This project is made with love and for us to do something fun.

Currently, work in progress.
